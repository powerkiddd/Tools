# Tools
A simple game made in Java

#About Tools
This game is a blocky 2D sidescrolling game about making factories and poluting the world.
Your choices on how you make your factories will depend how the game will progress.
You will start out having no tools and materials at all, these you will have to make and mine.
Eventually you will start automating some things by building your first factories and power generated by steam.
From there, you will expand your operations and create a magnificant factory!
